# UltraPlonk zk-SNARK Verifier

The UltraPlonk zk-SNARK verifier is a Rust-based implementation of Noir's UltraPlonk Solidity verifier, optimized to be used contextually with [zkVerify](https://github.com/zkVerify/zkVerify).

## Usage

For full usage example, see [examples/rust_example.rs](./examples/main.rs).

```rust
use ultraplonk_no_std::verify;
use hex_literal::hex;

fn main() {
  let proof_data = hex!("15d2...79b3");

  let vk_data = hex!("0000...0000");

  let pubs = [ hex!("000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a") ];

  verify::<()>(&vk_data, &proof_data, &pubs).unwrap();
}
```

# Zk-SNARK Conversion Tool UltraPlonk → ZKVerify

## Problem

Currently, developers using the Noir/Nargo stack with the UltraPlonk backend face a critical limitation: **the lack of tools to convert zk-SNARK proofs generated via CLI (`bb`) into a format compatible with ZKVerify**. This prevents direct frontend integrations with modern verifiers.

Developers working with UltraPlonk face the following barriers:

- Proofs generated by `bb prove` are binary (`.bin`) and incompatible with ZKVerify.
- Conversion to hex format is only possible via CLI, preventing frontend/browser usage.
- There is no official solution for runtime conversion via JavaScript.

## Solution

This library provides an **open-source JavaScript/TypeScript library** that:

- Converts proofs and `Uint8Array` keys generated by `@aztec/bb.js` to `hex` in Node.js or browser environments.
- Generates the proof format accepted by ZKVerify from the UltraPlonk structure.
- Provides a user-friendly API for Web3 developers, DApps, and ZK tools.

> This library **is already functional as a PoC**, with successful proof submissions to ZKVerify.

## Proof of Feasibility

The developed PoC already demonstrates that:

- Conversion can be done entirely in Node.js without CLI.
- The converted format is accepted by ZKVerify's API.
- It can run in Node.js backend.
